## Approach to Animation

For this project, we aimed to recreate Pacita Abad's 'Wheels of Fortune' artwork, re-interpreting it in a modern context. My individual approach to animating the group code involved adding dynamic elements to the artwork to make it more lively and vibrant. I decided to implement rotating and color-changing elements to bring an interactive aspect to the art, inviting viewers to engage with it and have fun.

### Animation Driver

I decided to work with mouse interaction as my animation driver. By using mouse movements, users can directly influence the rotation and color changes of the elements in the artwork, providing an engaging and interactive experience. The properties I animated are the color and rotation of the flower petals, diamonds and radiating lines. The petals and circles surrounding the diamonds change color randomly when the mouse is clicked, adding dynamic visual elements to the artwork. Additionally, the diamonds and radiating lines rotate subtly as the user moves the mouse, creating an immersive and lively effect.

### Animated Properties

The properties of the image that I animated include rotation and color changes. Unlike other group members who focused on different aspects of animation, such as component sizes or revealing components over time, my contribution aimed to enhance the overall dynamism of the artwork through continuous rotation and vibrant color transitions.

### Inspiration and Influence

For inspiration, I referenced my 'week 8 assignment', where I was inspired by the rotating stone artwork created by [Kreatives](https://www.kreatives.co/stone). Drawing from this inspiration, I incorporated similar dynamic elements into our project to effectively add movement and energy to the artwork.

### Technical Explanation

My individual code works by continuously updating the rotation angle and color values of the animated elements based on user's mouse interaction. The `update()` function will detect mouse movements and adjusts the animation parameters accordingly, while the `display()` function renders the animated elements with updated properties.
